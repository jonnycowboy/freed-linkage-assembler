  "Algorithm for finding a closed-form assembly
  procedure for a given constraint system, if one exists.
  Otherwise, the algorithm finds an iterative solution
  with a minimal number for redundant generalized
  coordinates.

  Inputs:
  model : the constraint system model
  input : the user specified driving input
  degen : any known degeneracies

  Outputs:
  success? : a boolean indicating success (or failure)

  Variables:
  graph : the constraint graph
  conn : the constraint graph connectivity array
  plan : the metaphorical assembly plan
  redundant : the list of redundant generalized coordinates
  aloop : a loop that is to be solved

  We update a link map and a marker map with invariants.
  The link map of invariants indicates just how well placed the link is.

  invariant and producing link versors, until no more constraints can be satisfied.
  The link versors are then returned along with the constraint plan.
