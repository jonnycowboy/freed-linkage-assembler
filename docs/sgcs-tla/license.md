The work in this project is based on the published work of Dr. Glenn A. Kramer
while employeed at Schlumberger.

My Intent
=========

I am working on an open source geometric constraint solver based on your work as found in "Solving Geometric Constraint Systems", 1992.
I would like to include the source code provided in the Appendix of that book as a reference implementation.
In order to do that I will need a license to reproduce that copyright material.
Would you allow me to release your work under an open source license (e.g. LGPL or MIT)?
Thank you.

Dear Fred Eisele,

Thank you for your message.  I am happy to grant to you non-exlcusive permission to include the Appendix from Solving Geometric Constraint Systems with your open source project.  Please indicate that the Appendix is reprinted from Glenn A. Kramer, Solving Geometric Constraint Systems:  A Case Study in Kinematics, courtesy of The MIT Press.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Very best,

Hi Fred,

This is what I have found out:

The book is copyright 1992 MIT, so you would have to contact MIT Press, rather than me, for permission to use the code (from a copyright perspective). It looks like the last patent expires April 1, 2014, so your timing is perfect with respect to patent issues!

As to the issue I raised about the code being a work made for hire, I did contact my previous manager, my previous legal counsel, and a colleague who still works for Schlumberger. Nobody can figure out a channel for asking permission, but the lawyer pointed out that by publishing the code in a book, they can't really claim there are any trade secrets, and apparently the copyright must have been transferred by agreement to MIT, or the book would never have been published (MIT Press is a stickler for clean IP).

So while I can't speak for Schlumberger, I think you would only need to get permission from MIT. (Please remember I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice :-)

Thanks again for contacting me. I'm flattered that you did a re-implementation. And I would be very interested to see whether you are successful with MIT (I'm betting you will be). If so, and if I have any vote, I'd opt for the MIT license.

Please keep me posted. (redacted)

Best,
Glenn
